# Contributing

All contributions are welcome, and the rules to have your PR accepted are few.

The rules are:

1 - All code contributions must be formatted with codeFormatter.php using default params.

2 - If you are going to contribute with an extra pass in the codeFormatter.php, you will become the owner of it and I will expect you to maintain it in the capacity of lieutenant. If you make a PR to a Pass which has a maintainer, it will be dropped and told to address the maintainer instead.

3 - Ideally, all public methods should be documented as they are part of public interface.

4 - None of the changes may affect the core passes. This is assessed through tests (tests/* and tests-PSR/*). Each maintainer is free to choose a policy regarding tests, including having no tests whatsoever.

5 - Goto 1


## Maintainer is not responding?

Open the PR and let me know about the non-responsive maintainer. I may take over, or appoint you as the new maintainer.
